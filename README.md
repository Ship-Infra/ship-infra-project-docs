# Ship Infra — Terraform AWS Tutorial & Learning Guide 🚀

**Terraform + AWS from zero to running backend infra — step-by-step, beginner friendly.**
Clone the tutorial, follow the guide, and by the end you’ll have a working AWS backend (VPC, infra scaffolding) — no Terraform or AWS prior knowledge required.

---

## 🧭 What is this

Many developers and small teams struggle with the steep learning curve of Terraform + AWS.
Ship Infra is a **free, open-source learning guide** that walks you through:

- Setting up AWS credentials & basics
- Writing Terraform for AWS infra (networking, services)
- Bootstrapping backend infra — step by step
- Real-world examples and explanations

---

## 📚 Why this guide exists

- 🛠️ AWS + Terraform is powerful — but confusing for beginners.
- 💡 There’s a lack of simple, practical tutorials that build a real infra from a “nothing” baseline.
- 🔭 I believe clarity & documentation matter. Once enough people learn via this guide, I plan to build a CLI / automation tool that simplifies this process even further.

---

## 🎯 Who is this for

- Indie developers or small startup founders launching backend services
- Devs new to infrastructure-as-code or AWS
- Curious engineers wanting a working example rather than theoretical docs

---

## 🚀 Get started: quick path

```
git clone https://github.com/Ship-Infra/ship-infra-project.git
cd ship-infra-project
# Open the docs at https://ship-infra-project.viktorvasylkovskyi.com
```

Then follow the tutorials step-by-step.

---

## ✅ What you get

- Step-by-step Terraform + AWS guide from zero → deployed infra
- Example templates / configs that you can reuse or fork
- Explanations & best-practices, not just code
- Full control and learning — no black-box automation

---

## 🌱 Future vision

I plan to build a CLI on top of this guide that — given a container image — bootstraps a full working AWS infra (networking, services, CI) in minutes.
