title: Ship Infrastructure V2 - A Production Ready Infrastructure as Code Guide
---

In this guide, we will enhance the basic three-tier web application infrastructure we built in the [beginner's guide](../v1-beginer-infrastructure-as-code/) to make it production ready. We will address key aspects such as security, scalability, monitoring, and disaster recovery to ensure that our infrastructure can handle real-world workloads reliably and securely.
